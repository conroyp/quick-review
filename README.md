Quick Review
=======

When viewing a pull request on github, our team uses a "+1" notation as our "looks good to me",
or sign of approval. This extension adds a big

icon to the bottom right of a pull request page, allowing one-click approval of a pull request.
This is mainly useful when reviewing a long diff, saving the navigation back to the comment tab and
towards the comment box.

Installation
-----------
* Clone the repo locally
* In chrome, go to Tools -> Extensions
* Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked
